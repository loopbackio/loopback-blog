Can you believe it's been 5 years that LoopBack 4 GA was [announced](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/loopback-4-ga) at Node+JS Interactive conference?

Since then, the framework has gained stability and has gained users substantially. We also see more contributions from the community not only to the core framework, but also building extensions. Thank you for all your contributions to LoopBack and the [160+ extensions published on npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=loopback-extension)!

To continue moving towards an open governace model, it's exciting to see LoopBack [joined the OpenJS foundation as the incubating project](https://openjsf.org/blog/2021/06/02/loopback-joins-openjs-foundation-as-new-incubating-project/) in 2021 and [graduated to at-large project](https://openjsf.org/blog/2022/04/25/node-js-framework-loopback-graduates-to-at-large-project-at-openjs-foundation/) the following year.

Lastly, don't forget that [HacktoberFest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) is on this month. No matter you're a new developer to LoopBack or seasoned contributors, your contributions are always welcomed!
